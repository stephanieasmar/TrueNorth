                                <li>Gap Analysis, in which True North compares the telecommunications supplier’s current QMS, if any, to TL 9000 requirements, identifies nonconformities and recommends actions to achieve conformity.</li>
                                <li>TL 9000 Overview, describing QMS and registration requirements.</li>
                                <li>Quality Manual Development, creating a document that describes QMS policy, procedures, requirements, goals and structures.</li>
                                <li>Procedures Development, covering methods, strategies and principles used to perform QMS activities.</li>
                                <li>Registrar Liaison, contacting an accredited third-party firm that audits the QMS, its documentation and implementation for TL 9000 registration.</li>
                                <li>Management Representative Selection, assisting in choosing the person with day-to-day responsibility for QMS development and implementation, as well as liaison between management and the registrar.</li>
                                <li>Procedures Implementation, ensuring QMS conformity to TL 9000.</li>
                                <li>Internal Audit Assistance, to monitor QMS implementation for conformity to TL 9000.</li>
                                <li>Corrective Action Assistance, to eliminate QMS nonconformities found during internal audits.</li>

                                <h4>Maintenance Program</h4>
                            </div>
                            <p>Once TL 9000 registration has been achieved, the quality management system (QMS) must be maintained. The True North TL 9000 Maintenance Program can perform this work in a cost-effective and efficient manner, tailored to fit the client’s needs.</p>
                            <p>The TL 9000 Maintenance Program may include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Internal Audits, which are a crucial component in QMS checks and balances, for discovering a major nonconformity during an internal audit can prevent registration from being revoked during the subsequent surveillance audit. True North can conduct internal audits twice a year in a professional, efficient and even-handed manner.</li>
                                <li>Corrective Actions, which are performed after surveillance audits to close out nonconformities.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <div id="definitions"></div>
                            <p>The TL 9000 Maintenance Program frees up client personnel for regular job duties and costs less than committing a client employee to QMS upkeep.</p>

                </div>
                <p><span>ISO 9000</span> is a set of international standards on quality management and quality assurance developed to help companies effectively document the quality system elements to be implemented to maintain an efficient quality system. They are not specific to any one industry and can be applied to organizations of any size. The ISO 9000 family of quality management systems standards is designed to help organizations ensure that they meet the needs of customers and other stakeholders while meeting statutory and regulatory requirements related to a product or service.</p>
                <p><span>ISO 14001</span> is a standard related to environmental management that exists to help organizations minimize how their operations negatively affect the environment; comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other environmentally oriented requirements; and continually improve in the above. ISO 14001 is the international standard that specifies requirements for an effective environmental management system (EMS). It provides a framework that an organization can follow, rather than establishing environmental performance requirements.</p>
                <p><span>ISO/TS 16949</span> is an ISO technical specification aimed at the development of a quality management system that provides for continual improvement, emphasizing defect prevention and the reduction of variation and waste in the automotive industry supply chain.</p>
                <p><span>AS9100</span> is an aerospace standard based on the ISO 9001 quality system requirements. AS9100 takes the ISO9000 requirements and supplements them with additional quality system requirements, which are established by the aerospace industry in order to satisfy DOD, NASA and FAA quality requirements.</p>
                <p><span>TL 9000</span> is a technical specification aimed at the development of a quality management system to meet the supply chain and operational quality requirements of the global information and communication technologies (ICT) industry. TL 9000 is built on ISO 9001 and its quality principles.</p>
                <p><span>RoHS</span> is the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive 2002/95/EC, (RoHS 1), short for Directive on the restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. The RoHS 1 directive took effect on 1 July 2006, and is required to be enforced and became a law in each member state. This directive restricts the use of six hazardous materials in the manufacture of various types of electronic and electrical equipment. </p>
