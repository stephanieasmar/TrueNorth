                        <div class="project-image"><img src="resources/images/vision.png" alt="vision"></div>
                        <p>When we began myPhotoAtlas, there were two aspects we wanted to incorporate into our final product: maps and photos. If nothing else, we wanted to build an application geared toward specific users: photography enthusiasts and travellers exploring a new location. Over time, our concept evolved into much more than we initially imagined. Our final product allows the user to search any location and returns a gallery of photos taken within a specific radius of that location. Additional features include the ability to get directions and save/delete locations and images to the ‘myPlaces’ page. In the future we would like to incorporate a backend server and database, which will allow the user to login to their own profile. We would also like to utilize another API which will give the user information on their chosen locations (i.e. wikipedia, etc.).</p>

                        <div class="project-image"><img src="resources/images/methods.png" alt="methods"></div>
                        <p>Despite building this product in less than six days, we implemented Agile methodology as well as a few other software development techniques. We began by creating a user persona and story-mapping the users’ product experience from beginning to end. We then wire-framed our concept and composed a 3-4 page website. Throughout this process, we implemented 1-day sprints. After our daily sprints, we got together for a mini-retrospective to discuss our roadblocks and any other issues we had for that day. Our day-to-day workflow consisted of collaborative mob-programming as well as individual programming. We also ensured that each team member was contributing equally to the project and getting the experience that she needed to improve her skills. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed the process of creating this product and believe that the applied best practices and methodologies allowed for a great experience.</p>

                        <div class="project-image"><img src="resources/images/tools2.png" alt="tools"></div>

                        <p>To achieve the style and functionality we were looking for, we used the following tools and languages: HTML, CSS/Flexbox, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, APIs(Google, Flickr), AJAX, and Trello. Our styling primarily came from Flexbox within CSS. Bootstrap complemented the CSS in creating button functionality and enhancing the user experience. JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX helped us create a fluid user experience and intuitive interaction. In addition, these programs work behind the scenes gathering data from Google Maps and Flickr APIs, while keeping track of a user's saved places in local storage and much more. These APIs truly helped make our vision a reality. Finally, Trello helped manage our project backlog and track progress. It kept us focused on our goals and on the right path towards a finished product.</p>

                        <p>Through her time spent serving in the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps, Sarah discovered she loved solving problems.  She was inspired to learn software development after working for the government and wanting to improve the programs she used daily. She began utilizing online tools, like Codecademy and freeCodeCamp, to study programming after work each day. She decided to further her learning and complete a full-time software development course at DigitalCrafts. Her skills include Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, React.js, MySQL, Express, and AWS.</p>
